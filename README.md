# Hi there! 👋🏽
I'm Ramón, a Junior Data Analyst focused on leveraging data insights to optimize operational efficiency and enhance the Customer Experience (CX).

With over 15 years of solid experience in high-stakes, bilingual customer service and operations (across financial services, e-commerce, and mobility), I possess a unique ability to translate real-world business challenges into data-driven analytical queries.

🔭 I'm currently working on: Applying Data Science methodologies (Python/SQL) to validate patterns and generate actionable insights from complex operational data.

🌱 I'm currently mastering: Python (Pandas, NumPy), SQL, and data visualization tools like Tableau.

👯 I'm looking to collaborate on: Projects that sit at the intersection of Customer Service, Process Optimization, and Data Analysis. I am eager to help teams turn operational friction into measurable improvements.
